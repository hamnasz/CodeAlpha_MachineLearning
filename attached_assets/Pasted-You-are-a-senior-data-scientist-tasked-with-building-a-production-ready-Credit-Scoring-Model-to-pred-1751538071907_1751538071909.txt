You are a senior data scientist tasked with building a production-ready Credit Scoring Model to predict an individual's creditworthiness using historical financial data. Follow these specific instructions:

Goal: Develop a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to accurately predict creditworthiness.

Data Context:
Assume access to a structured dataset containing the following features (can be extended as needed):

Annual Income

Total Debts

Payment History (e.g., number of late payments)

Employment Status

Credit Utilization Rate

Age, Education, and other relevant demographics

Tasks to Perform:

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:

Clean missing or inconsistent data.

Engineer additional features from raw financial history (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, average payment delays).

Handle categorical variables appropriately (e.g., encoding techniques).

Model Development:

Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics:

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Compare models and select the best-performing one based on business and statistical criteria.

Production Considerations:

Discuss model interpretability (especially for regulatory compliance in credit decisions).

Suggest methods for ongoing model monitoring and retraining.

Provide recommendations for data pipelines and deployment strategy.

Constraints:

The model must be explainable to non-technical stakeholders (feature importance, decision rules).

Prioritize avoiding bias or unfair treatment of individuals based on sensitive attributes.

Assume access to standard Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

Output Expected:

Step-by-step model development process

Feature engineering examples

Model evaluation results with interpretation

Production-readiness checklist
